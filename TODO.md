Hassel Wasm Emu TODO
====================

- [ ] Play/pause
  - Need to execute 6,000,000 cycles per second for realistic timing
  - Can't give full control to Wasm or the browser will freak out
  - Perhaps run 600,000 cycles on a 100 millisecond interval?
  - The Wasm-side of the emulator will need to be aware of breakpoints
- [ ] Breakpoints
- [ ] Memory View
- [ ] Graphics
- [ ] Input
